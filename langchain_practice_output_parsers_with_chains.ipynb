The world is experiencing unprecedented changes in its climate patterns, resulting in adverse environmental, social, and economic impacts. Climate change is no longer a future threat; it is a present-day reality that requires urgent action. The Earth's climate has been warming at an alarming rate, causing sea-level rise, melting glaciers, more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather conditions. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to mitigate climate change. It will also discuss the current state of climate change, its effects on various sectors, and the steps being taken to address the issue.\n",

            "The primary cause of climate change is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a greenhouse effect that traps heat in the atmosphere, causing global warming. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 47% since the industrial revolution, leading to a temperature increase of 1.1°C (NASA, 2021). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that human activities are the leading cause of climate change, with the top 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988 (IPCC, 2018). Methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases also contribute to global warming. The concentration of methane, the second most potent greenhouse gas, has doubled since pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2018). The Arctic ice caps are melting, leading to sea-level rise, and the oceans are absorbing less carbon, causing more warming. The warming oceans are also causing more frequent and intense hurricanes and typhoons.\n",
