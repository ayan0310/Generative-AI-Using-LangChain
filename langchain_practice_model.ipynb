            "The product of 3 and 10 is 30 (3 times 10). When we say \"3 multiply by 10,\" it means we are scaling a number by a factor of 10, which is the same as moving the decimal point to the right by 1 place. For example, if we have a number with a decimal point, such as 3.6, we can write it as 0.36. To move the decimal point to the right by one place, we multiply it by 10, which is equivalent to multiplying it by 10. So, 3.6 becomes 36 in this case. This is called decimal point notation, and it's a way to represent a number with a decimal point. If we multiply 3 by 10, we are essentially shifting the decimal point one place to the right, making it 300 in this case. This is useful in math and science when dealing with measurements that involve powers of 10, such as meters, kilograms, or liters. For instance, 3 meters is written as 3000 millimeters (3000 millimeters is 3 meters).\n",

            "\n",
            "In other words, when we say \"3 multiply by 10,\" we're multiplying by 10, which is the same as moving the decimal point one place to the right. This is a common operation in scientific notation, where we write numbers in the form of a decimal with a power of 10. For example, 3 x 10^1 is 30 in scientific notation, and 3 x 10^2 is 300. This is a quick way to represent large or small numbers that would be difficult to write out in full. It's also useful in calculations where we need to perform operations with decimal numbers.\n",
