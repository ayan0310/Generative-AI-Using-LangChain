            "A penalty in football, also known as soccer in some parts of the world, is a free kick awarded to a team when the opposing team commits a foul inside their own penalty area, typically resulting from an offense such as a handball, trip, or foul against an attacking player who is considered to be in a promising scoring position. The penalty kick is taken from 12 yards (11 meters) away from the goal line, with the offending team's goalkeeper required to remain on their goal line until the ball is in play. The penalty taker has the opportunity to score a goal from the spot, with only the goalkeeper to beat, making it one of the most high-pressure situations in the game. Penalties are a crucial part of the sport, as they can be decisive in determining the outcome of matches and can often be the difference between victory, defeat, or a draw. In professional leagues, such as the English Premier League, penalties are taken by some of the most skilled and precise players on the team, known as penalty specialists or dead-ball experts, who are trusted to convert them the majority of the time. Successfully converting penalties requires a combination of technique, strategy, and mental focus, as the pressure of the situation can be intense, and the opposing team's goalkeeper will often try to guess the direction of the shot to make a save. The penalty spot is marked by white paint on the grass, and the ball is placed on the penalty spot, with the penalty taker having the freedom to choose where they want to shoot the ball within that area. The team that scores the most penalties in a match or tournament often has an advantage, as it indicates a strong attacking performance and discipline in not committing unnecessary fouls. Penalties are also awarded in other situations, such as after two yellow cards against the same player, resulting in a sending-off (red card), and in some cases, for encroachment by the defending team before the kick is taken. The team that scores the most penalties over the course of a season or tournament often has a higher chance of winning the competition.\n"
